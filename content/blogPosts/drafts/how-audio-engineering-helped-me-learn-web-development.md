I grew up with a handful of different hobbies and interests.

When I was younger, I played sports which lead me to choose basketball as my main sport. Got pretty good to be honest, with respect to my age range.

I also got into skateboarding and longboarding. Trying to learn how to ollie, shove-it, and heelflip were some of my first challenges. But I also tried to go into longboard sliding and downhill racing. But living in a literal flat town, that didn't go anywhere.

In high school, I took a graphic design class. Photoshop and Illustrator skills still serve a purpose for me today.

Economics in high school exposed me to the world of the stock market. I actually loved it and started following the stock market with those virtual market app games and played with fake money to follow profit and losses.

I've also always loved science and eventually dove deep into astronomy and theoretical astrophysics.

This was all for fun... I had a very wide range of interests.

One of my favorite hobbies was (and still is) music. This lead me to become the 'sound guy' at the local church I attended.

## Deep Dive Into The Audio World

To this day, I still enjoy playing around with friends recording some song covers, or even original song ideas. I still occasionally run the soundboard at my current local church. But it wasn't always so easy.

I am 90% self-taught in my audio skills. I started 7 years ago when I was 15 years old. And when I say it was a deep dive, it was a serious **deep dive**.

I had someone more experienced show me around during my first few weeks. Then he had a kid soon after and took a break from being involved with sound, rightfully so. The other sound guy was moving away at the same time.

So there left me. A 15 year old kid, about a month into doing sound; I'm the only person in the whole church who was available to run sound now.

I had no idea what I was doing.

So I ended up doing a bunch of self-learning through Youtube videos, playing around with DAW software ([Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/) 7 at the time), and spent tons of extra hours at my church to really dial in details with sound and learn their system.

Then, about a year later, they announced they would be moving from a dedicated building where the sound system was set up all the time, to a high school auditorium. This meant we would have to unload a trailer with **all** of our audio equipment, set it up early in the morning, use it for one church service, dismantle the entire system, store it away in said trailer, and repeat. Every single week.

I was terrified, as I was the only dedicated sound guy at the church.

Then, one day, came the magic question:

"Can you design the new sound system for us?"

_Well, here we go..._

## Translating Audio Engineering to Javascript

I went from learning what a certain knob or switch does, and how to take out a little bit of feedback, to needing to learn what an entire sound system even needs for it work, how to dismantle and rebuild it, and what type of equipment is best suited to take such an "on-the-road" beating.

This practically became my first job. People make livings with what I learned to do, and I was pretty much paid in coffee. Still grateful for that though, not gonna lie... I needed it for 5:30am Sunday mornings.
